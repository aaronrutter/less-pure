less-pure
=========
 Working with [purecss] (https://github.com/yahoo/pure/) and [bootstrap] (https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
 
 A drawback of the purcss framework is the requirement to embed classes into your HTML. 
 This is an attempt to make it easier to change between different CSS frameworks.
 The philosophy of this project is a minimal deliviarable product 
 
The Future
----------
 1. First thing is to get the css files converted to LESS sytax, pretty easy considering the overlap.
 2. Next is to move blocks and elements into a mixin file structure
 3. Structure a grunt task to build dev version
